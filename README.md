Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to extract actionable insights. By querying the dataset, I aim to:
Assess Sales Performance: 
Measure total orders and revenue.
Identify Key Metrics: 
Find the highest-priced items, most common sizes, and top-selling pizzas.
Analyze Trends: 
Examine order distribution by time and daily averages.
Revenue Insights: 
Determine revenue contributions of different pizza types and categories.
Data is sourced from [GitHub Repository: Pizza Sales SQL](https://github.com/Ayushi0214/pizza-sales---SQL). This analysis will support strategic decisions on menu offerings, pricing, and promotions.
