# Pizzahut---data-analysis

Project Objective :-
The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to extract actionable insights. By querying the dataset, I aim to:
  Assess Sales Performance: 
    Measure total orders and revenue.
  Identify Key Metrics: 
    Find the highest-priced items, most common sizes, and top-selling pizzas.
  Analyze Trends: 
    Examine order distribution by time and daily averages.
  Revenue Insights: 
    Determine revenue contributions of different pizza types and categories.
